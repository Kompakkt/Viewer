<h3>Show octree boxes</h3>

<p>Toggle the visibility of boxes displaying the loading zones of the octree.</p>

<p>
  Reaching a loading zone with the camera will initiate loading of the respective octree of the
  point cloud, if the octree is in the configured level of detail.
</p>

<p>
  A larger box indicates a lower level of detail, and smaller boxes indicate higher levels of
  detail.
